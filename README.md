## Introduction

This project is a single-page touristic website developed using HTML and CSS. The website aims to showcase various tourist destinations, attractions, and activities to potential travelers. It provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface to explore different places and gather information about them.


## Top Three Activities in Stockholm
- An apocalyptic underground art tour
- Djurgården’s world-class museums
- Stockholm’s city centre consists of 14 islands, but that’s nothing compared with the tens of thousands that make up its sprawling archipelago
